# FleaFlicker-Web-Scrape

After missing my league's fantasy football playoffs I had a hypothesis (like any true fantasy player) that I couldn't possibly have lost due to poor decision making: it must have been luck! Fleaflicker.com retains luck scores for each game. The fleaflicker_webscrape.py file pulls the information from the website and as an academic exercise I save it to my local SQL database.
